- 👋 Hi, I’m @MustangMike96
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to better use Python, mainly, but also C, and all forms of it! I also like BASIC even though I was born after BASIC was already obsolete and have written a terrible text adventure for the C64/C128 that rips off every RPG ever while using Zelda characters, in text form. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use code to analyze data sets, whether spreadsheets or visual.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I started college in 2014 as a comp-sci major before switching to a hard science after two years. Then Covid happened and I learned how to program in BASIC, writing that afformentioned terrible text adventure. I then decided to test myself by porting the framework to Python, C++, and Java. All were a success, but Python was the winner for my goals.
